# Crowdfunding_ETL

The requirements didn't actually mention a read me file for this project but i can confidently say that most of the resources used to complete the tasks in this project referenced the previous lectures heavily as well as chatgpt. During the last part of the jupyter notebook we used chat gpt especially when figuring out the REGEX portion of the third task. 

when it came to the sql portion of the project we were not 100% sure we created the ERD image correctly and we also are not sure if we left anything out that needed to be included for this portion specifically. Please let us know if anything is missing and we can provide you with the required files needed for a complete grade!
